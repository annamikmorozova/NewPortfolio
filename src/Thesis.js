                    After 40 years of being left untouched, the lunar surface was visited by a Chinese rover in 2013. 
                    The significance of this landing was not only the technological advancement of Chinese space technology, 
                    but it was also the first time, after a long time, that the moon had been visited at all; most importantly, 
                    by a country other than the Soviet Union and the United States. Given the significance of the event as one that 
                    occurred by a 3rd country that was not a member of the original Cold War ‘Space Race’, the response of 
                    the original two Space Race contestants would appear to be a critical barometer of attitude towards increasingly 
                    crowded heavens. Media analysis on that Chinese rover landing in 2013 suggests, from a game theory 
                    perspective, an approach rooted in pragmatism – a nash equilibrium outcome when it comes to reporting on 
                    Chinese space activities; a non-optimal, but stable, the advancement of common interests. 
                    This paper tests that theory out by conducting an in-depth critical analysis of media reporting from 
                    both the American and Russian side to determine whether or not the ‘New Kid on the Lunar Block’ is indeed 
                    being treated through this lens, or if reporting suggests a different mediated reality, one rooted either in 
                    extremely positive or extremely negative socio-political views of Chinese’s advancement into a literal space 
                    reserved until 2013 for the classic giants of the Space Race.

                    Introduction
                </div>
                <p>
                    The USA is the only country, up to the current time, that has successfully completed manned missions to the Moon. 
                    Although unable to complete a manned mission, until 2013 Russia has been the only other space power capable of successfully 
                    landing on the Moon. China, since 2013, is just the third country to successfully land a human object on the lunar surface.
                    While the global media has not celebrated China’s Chang’e Lunar program as much as that of its two predecessors, the importance 
                    of China’s technological achievement should not be underestimated. China’s success with its lunar missions will certainly 
                    affect future technologies and policies. As China enters the ‘Space Race’, it is interesting to study how Russian and American 
                    media react to China’s success and its upcoming missions.
                    From 1976 to 2013, despite significant technological progress in space technology, there had not been a single human or 
                    robotic landing on the lunar surface. On December 14, 2013, the China Space Agency successfully landed the Chang’e 3 rover at the rim 
                    of a small crater on the Moon. While not nearly as widely reported internationally as the prior lunar landing missions in the 1960’s and 1970’s, 
                    this singular event represented not only the first successful lunar landing mission in almost 4 decades, but it also represented the first time 
                    there was a ‘proverbial’ new kid on the block – a competitor to the classic titans of the cold war ‘space race’, with an apparent capacity for technological 
                    parity that could easily equal or surpass Russia or the United States.
                    Given the significance of the ‘new kid on the block’, this article applies classical 
                    game theory modeling to media reporting and asks the basic question: how did Russia and the United States react? To the extent 
                    that media reporting, whether through state-sponsored or private media channels, represents an accurate ‘voice of the country’, we can use the 
                    tonality and orientation of their reporting as an indicator of perception of the ‘new kid on the block’ as either a classic ‘friend or foe’ and determine, 
                    by extension, which model of game theory most nearly fits the behavior of Russia and the United States.
